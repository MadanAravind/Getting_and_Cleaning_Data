Data Zip File Location: UC Irvine Repo

Goal of the Project
1. A tidy data set
2. A link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis
3. A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I performed to clean up the data called        CodeBook.md.I also included a README.md in the repo with. This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.
4. Analysis R Script

# 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
# 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
# 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
# 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
# 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
# Load Packages and get the Data
# Load activity labels + features
# Load train datasets
# Load test datasets
# merge datasets
# Convert classLabels to activityName basically. More explicit.
